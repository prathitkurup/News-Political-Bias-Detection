# News-Political-Bias-Detection

Deep Learning Final Project

Zero Shot Zealots: Albert Tang, Prathit Kurup, Sandesh Ghmire

## Abstract:

We will create a model for detecting political bias of news articles based on headlines and content. We will train on the [Qbias dataset](https://github.com/irgroup/Qbias). Qbias is a dataset of over 21 thousand news articles classified as left-, center-, or right-leaning with their headlines, tags, source, and text. These news articles are sourced and rated for bias by professionals at US-based news aggregator [AllSides](https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news).

## Future Work:

We will experiment with different architectures and tokenization techniques.
